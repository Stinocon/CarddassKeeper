## 🌟 About This Project

I created this project during my free time after diving into collecting vintage Pokémon Carddass cards from 1997. Many of these cards come directly from Japan through auctions—it's quite the adventure: bidding, winning, and then patiently waiting for packages to arrive across the globe! 

I wanted something more engaging and visual than a boring Excel spreadsheet to track my collection, and this is what came to life. It's designed to make collecting more organized, enjoyable, and efficient.

## 🎯 Why I Made It

**The Problem**: Managing a growing card collection with just spreadsheets is tedious and error-prone.

**The Solution**: A beautiful, interactive web interface that makes tracking your collection actually enjoyable:
- ✅ Visual tracking of owned cards
- 📦 Order management to avoid duplicate purchases  
- 🏆 Grading status tracking for serious collectors
- 📊 Real-time statistics and completion tracking
- 🌙 Dark mode for late-night collection sessions
