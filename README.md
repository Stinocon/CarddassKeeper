## About This Project

I created this project in my free time after starting a small collection of vintage Pokémon Carddass cards from 1997.  
Many of these cards are purchased directly from Japan, which means the process can be… quite the adventure: participating in auctions, winning them, and then patiently waiting for the package to arrive. I wanted something better than a boring Excel file to keep track of the cards I already have — and here we are.  

## Why I Made It

This project helps me track which cards I already own in my collection, making it easier to manage purchases and avoid duplicates.  
It also keeps things more visual and organized compared to spreadsheets.

## How It’s Built

It’s just a simple HTML page — nothing fancy. I didn’t code everything from scratch, but instead used a mix of AI tools to make my life easier.  
It works well enough for what I need.

### Key Features
- Visual tracking of owned cards
- Simple and fast to update
- No backend, just static HTML for easy hosting
- Designed for personal use, but reusable by other collectors
- Dark mode because why not
- Export in various format

## Demo

You can try out the live demo of this project right here: [Pokédass-Manager Demo](https://stinocon.github.io/Pokedass-Manager/index.html)

Heads-up: since this is a pure static HTML page with **no backend or database**, all your data is stored locally in your browser (probably via localStorage or something similar).  
That means **if you reboot your PC, clear your browser cache, switch browsers, or just decide to live dangerously**, all your saved card data will vanish into the void—poof, gone.  

So, if you care about your collection data, make sure to **back up your files manually** before doing any of the above. Use the export or save options provided, or just copy-paste your data somewhere safe.  

Basically: demo use is **at your own risk**. No server magic here, just pure static magic.

## Work in progress

There are obviously some rough edges and potential improvements planned:  

- The mobile version looks weird and needs some serious TLC  
- Adding a column to track whether a card is already owned or just ordered  
- Including useful links to websites and resources about the Carddass collection  

If you want to contribute or suggest features, feel free to open an issue or a pull request!
